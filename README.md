# PPExportClips

An extension for Premiere Pro that can export all the clips in a sequence.

---

## Instructions

Add repo to your extensions directory. As of writing, that directory is
`~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions` for Macs.

## Usage

Open Premiere Pro and in the Window dropdown, select Extensions, then Export
Clips. A new panel will open. Select your export preset and make sure your
active sequence is the one you are expecting. Click, "Render Clips" and select
your output directory when prompted.

This will only export clips on Video Track 1.
